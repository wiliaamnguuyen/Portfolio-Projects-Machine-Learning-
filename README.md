# Machine Learning Projects

I created this repository specifically to display Machine Learning concepts through projects; I wanted to help beginners by explaining the concept carried out through actual examples and therefore get an analytical edge in their learning. 

## Objectives
- Master Machine Learning on Python and R
- Make accurate predictions 
- Make robust Machine Learning models
- Handle advanced techniques like Dimensionality Reduction
- Build an army of powerful Machine Learning models and know how to combine them to solve any problem 
- Show future businesses I can provide strong added value to their goals through powerful analysis 
- Handle specific topics like Reinforcement Learning, NLP and Deep Learning
